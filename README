VERSION
    version 0.64

FAQ
  What is this?
    This distribution is a heterogenous collection of roles currently used
    in my modules and applications. The roles will eventually have their own
    proper names and distributions, if they prove to be worth it.

    See SHARYANTO about this temporary namespace.
